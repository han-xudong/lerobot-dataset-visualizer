# LeRobot Dataset Visualizer

LeRobot Dataset Visualizer is a web application for interactive exploration and visualization of robotics datasets, particularly those in the LeRobot format. It enables users to browse, view, and analyze episodes from large-scale robotics datasets, combining synchronized video playback with rich, interactive data graphs.

## Project Overview

This tool is designed to help robotics researchers and practitioners quickly inspect and understand large, complex datasets. It fetches dataset metadata and episode data (including video and sensor/telemetry data), and provides a unified interface for:

- Navigating between organizations, datasets, and episodes
- Watching episode videos
- Exploring synchronized time-series data with interactive charts
- Analyzing action quality and identifying problematic episodes
- Visualizing robot poses in 3D using URDF models
- Paginating through large datasets efficiently

## Key Features

- **Dataset & Episode Navigation:** Quickly jump between organizations, datasets, and episodes using a sidebar and navigation controls.
- **Synchronized Video & Data:** Video playback is synchronized with interactive data graphs for detailed inspection of sensor and control signals.
- **Overview Panel:** At-a-glance summary of dataset metadata, camera info, and episode details.
- **Statistics Panel:** Dataset-level statistics including episode count, total recording time, frames-per-second, and an episode-length histogram.
- **Action Insights Panel:** Data-driven analysis tools to guide training configuration — includes autocorrelation, state-action alignment, speed distribution, and cross-episode variance heatmap.
- **Filtering Panel:** Identify and flag problematic episodes (low movement, jerky motion, outlier length) for removal. Exports flagged episode IDs as a ready-to-run LeRobot CLI command.
- **3D URDF Viewer:** Visualize robot joint poses frame-by-frame in an interactive 3D scene, with end-effector trail rendering. Supports SO-100, SO-101, and OpenArm bimanual robots.
- **Efficient Data Loading:** Uses parquet and JSON loading for large dataset support, with pagination, chunking, and lazy-loaded panels for fast initial load.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS for a fast, modern user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **React**
- **Recharts** (for data visualization)
- **Three.js** + **@react-three/fiber** + **@react-three/drei** (for 3D URDF visualization)
- **urdf-loader** (for parsing URDF robot models)
- **hyparquet** (for reading Parquet files)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as its package manager. If you don't have it installed:

```bash
# Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx` or other files in the `src/` directory. The app supports hot-reloading for rapid development.

### Loading Datasets

The home page now supports two dataset sources:

- Hugging Face dataset ids, for example `lerobot/aloha_static_cups_open`
- Local LeRobot dataset directories, for example `/data/lerobot/my_dataset`

For local directories, the app expects a standard LeRobot layout with files such as `meta/info.json`, parquet files under `data/`, and video files under `videos/`.

### Local Directory Support

Local directory mode works by:

- Encoding the selected local path into the existing route structure
- Reading `meta/info.json`, parquet files, and metadata directly from disk on the server
- Serving local videos through an internal API route so the browser can stream them with HTTP range requests

Important constraints:

- The Next.js server process must have read access to the dataset directory
- The directory must exist on the same machine where the app is running
- Browser folder pickers usually do **not** expose the absolute directory path for security reasons

Because of that browser limitation, the Web version keeps the manual path input workflow.

The native `Choose Local Directory` button is available only in the Electron desktop app, where the OS file picker can return a real directory path.

### Desktop App (Electron)

The repository now includes an Electron shell for desktop builds.

- Web app: no directory picker button, manual local path input only
- Electron desktop app: shows a `Choose Local Directory` button on the home page

Useful commands:

```bash
# Start Next.js + Electron in development
bun run desktop:dev

# Build the Next.js standalone output for Electron
bun run desktop:build

# Produce desktop installers
bun run desktop:dist
```

### Other Commands

```bash
# Build for production
bun run build

# Start production server
bun start

# Start the Electron desktop app in development
bun run desktop:dev

# Run linter
bun run lint

# Format code
bun run format
```

### Environment Variables

- `DATASET_URL`: (optional) Base URL for dataset hosting (defaults to HuggingFace Datasets).

No extra environment variable is required for local datasets.

## Docker Deployment

This application can be deployed using Docker with bun for optimal performance and self-contained builds.

### Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t lerobot-visualizer .
```

### Run the container

```bash
docker run -p 7860:7860 lerobot-visualizer
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860).

### Run with custom environment variables

```bash
docker run -p 7860:7860 -e DATASET_URL=your-url lerobot-visualizer
```
